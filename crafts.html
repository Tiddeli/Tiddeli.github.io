    <h1 class="headone">Cosplay? Craft?</h1>
    <p>Cosplay is in short "Costume play". The phenomenon that is now growing rapidly over the world is challenging peoples creativity and ways to express oneself.
    </p>
    <p> One makes a costume, based on an existing character, and compete, takes photos or just hang around with like-minded people and share laughter and adventures. </p>

    <h2>The Anarch</h2>
    <p> As a Larper you sometimes have to come up with characters that is supposed to look nowhere near you, especially if they are a character you will play in a campaign you are known for playing one specific character for a longer time.
      This style and concept came up after I needed to think what character to play for a couple of times, while the main character was gone from the floor..</p>
